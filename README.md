🔐 Secure Access to AWS Secrets Manager using IAM & KMS

This project demonstrates secure access control to AWS Secrets Manager secrets that are protected by KMS (Key Management Service) encryption.
It uses an IAM user or IAM role with fine-grained permissions to list and retrieve secrets using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3).

🧠 Overview

Goal: Access AWS Secrets Manager secrets securely using IAM credentials.

Encryption: The secrets are encrypted using a KMS key created in your AWS account.

Access Control: Controlled via IAM policies (principle of least privilege).

Language: Python (uses boto3 and botocore libraries).

Input: Credentials loaded from creds.txt.

Output: Lists available secrets and retrieves the selected secret securely.

🧰 Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

AWS account with a configured KMS key and Secrets Manager secret.

IAM user or IAM role with permissions for:

secretsmanager:ListSecrets

secretsmanager:GetSecretValue

kms:Decrypt

Python 3.x installed.

boto3 and botocore libraries installed:

pip install boto3 botocore

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone or Download this Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

2️⃣ Configure Credentials

Create a file named creds.txt in the same directory as the script:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
AWS_REGION=<YOUR_AWS_REGION>
ASSUME_ROLE_ARN=<OPTIONAL_ROLE_ARN>


💡 ASSUME_ROLE_ARN is optional.
If not specified, the script will use the static credentials directly.
If provided, it will use STS to assume the given role temporarily.

🚀 How to Run

Run the script from your terminal:

python secrets-reader.py


What it does:

Loads AWS credentials from creds.txt.

Initializes a session using those credentials.

(Optional) Assumes the IAM role if ASSUME_ROLE_ARN is specified.

Lists all available secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

Prompts you to select a secret by name or number.

Retrieves and displays the secret value.

🧩 Example Output
Available Secrets in Secrets Manager:

1. MyAppSecret
2. DatabasePassword

Enter secret name (or number) to retrieve: 1

Secret Retrieved Successfully!

Secret Name: MyAppSecret
Secret Value: {"username":"dbadmin","password":"StrongPass123"}

🛡️ Security Notes

Avoid committing your actual creds.txt to GitHub — it should be .gitignored.

Use IAM roles (EC2, Lambda, etc.) instead of hardcoding credentials where possible.

Keep least privilege policies for KMS and Secrets Manager access.

Enable CloudTrail for auditing secret access events.

📜 Example IAM Policy

Attach this policy to your IAM user or role to grant access to the specific secret and key:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-south-1:111122223333:secret:MyAppSecret-*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:ap-south-1:111122223333:key/your-key-id"
    }
  ]
}

👥 Team Members
Name	Role
User 1	IAM User 1 / Team Member
User 2	IAM User 2 / Team Member
User 3	IAM User 3 / Team Member

Each user should have unique access credentials to test secure access.
